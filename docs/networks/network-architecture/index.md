Flow has pioneered a new paradigm of multi-node architecture that solves the core problem of todayâ€™s blockchains.
The result is scalable, decentralized, and secure network which ensures user safety and long-term sustainability.

To better understand the architecture, lets first understand the problems with the current blockchain. Then lets look at how Flow multi-node architecture solves these problems.
